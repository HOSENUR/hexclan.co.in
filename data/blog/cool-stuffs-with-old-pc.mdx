If you are like me and have a PC that you don't use anymore, you can build some really cool stuff with it.I have my personal Media Server, Network Storage, and have a few websites hosted which I use for my personal needs and stuff and still couldnt utilize all of my storage space.

_Note: All of the stuffs here can be accessed remotely but in this tutorial we are not gonna do that also you can use a cloud provider like Linode / Digital Ocean / Vultr if you want_

## What are we gonna build?

- A Media Server
- Network Storage
- Host A Website

## Gearing UP

Assuming you know how to install Linux, install your favourite, update & upgrade your system, and we are ready to get started.

## Media Server

**What is a media server?**

_Store all your movies, videos, images and music in one place and easily connect any device and start streaming_

Talking of media server, Plex is the most popular media server out there, but there's one issue, it's not free. So we will go for an opensource alternative [Emby](https://emby.media/download.html)

1. Download the latest version of [Emby](https://emby.media/download.html) Linux
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the downloads folder: `cd ~/Downloads`
3. Install Emby: `sudo dpkg -i emby-server-deb_4.6.7.0_amd64.deb`
4. Create a folder named `media` in your home directory and copy your favourite movies, series, music and images to this folder.
5. Open a terminal and add your user to emby `usermod -a -G username emby`
6. And that's it! navigate to [http://localhost:8096](http://localhost:8096) and you should be able to access your media server, add users, and add the media folder to your library. And now you have your own movie streaming platform.
